4.11 Multiple Access to the Same FITS File</A>
</H1>

<P>
CFITSIO supports simultaneous read and write access to multiple HDUs in
the same FITS file.  Thus, one can open the same FITS file twice within
a single program and move to 2 different HDUs in the file, and then
read and write data or keywords to the 2 extensions just as if one were
accessing 2 completely separate FITS files.   Since in general it is
not possible to physically open the same file twice and then expect to
be able to simultaneously (or in alternating succession) write to 2
different locations in the file, CFITSIO recognizes when the file to be
opened (in the call to fits_open_file) has already been opened and
instead of actually opening the file again, just logically links the
new file to the old file.  (This of course does not prevent the same
file from being simultaneously opened by more than one program).  Then
before CFITSIO reads or writes to either (logical) file, it makes sure
that any modifications made to the other file have been completely
flushed from the internal buffers to the file.  Thus, in principle, one
could open a file twice, in one case pointing to the first extension
and in the other pointing to the 2nd extension and then write data to
both extensions, in any order, without danger of corrupting the file.
There may be some efficiency penalties in doing this however, since
CFITSIO has to flush all the internal buffers related to one file
before switching to the  other, so it would still be prudent to
minimize the number of times one switches back and forth between doing
I/O to different HDUs in the same file.

<P>
Some restriction apply:  a FITS file cannot be opened the first time
with READONLY access, and then opened a second time with READWRITE access,
because this may be phyically impossible (e.g., if the file resides
on read-only media such as a CDROM).  Also, in multi-threaded environoments,
one should never open the same file with write access in different threads.
