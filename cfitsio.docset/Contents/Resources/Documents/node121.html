13.2 Optimization Strategies</A>
</H1>

<P>
1.  Because the data in FITS files is always stored in "big-endian" byte order,
where the first byte of numeric values contains the most significant bits and the
last byte contains the least significant bits, CFITSIO must swap the order of the bytes
when reading or writing FITS files when running on little-endian machines (e.g.,
Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems running on PCs with x86 CPUs).

<P>
On fairly new CPUs that support "SSSE3" machine instructions
(e.g., starting with Intel Core 2 CPUs in 2007, and in AMD CPUs
beginning in 2011) significantly faster 4-byte and 8-byte swapping
algorithms are available. These faster byte swapping functions are
not used by default in CFITSIO (because of the potential code
portablility issues), but users can enable them on supported
platforms by adding the appropriate compiler flags (-mssse3 with gcc
or icc on linux) when compiling the swapproc.c source file, which will
allow the compiler to generate code using the SSSE3 instruction set.
A convenient way to do this is to configure the CFITSIO library
with the following command:

<P>
<PRE>
  &gt;  ./configure --enable-ssse3
</PRE>
Note, however, that a binary executable file that is
created using these faster functions will only run on
machines that support the SSSE3 machine instructions. It will
crash on machines that do not support them.

<P>
For faster 2-byte swaps on virtually all x86-64 CPUs (even those that
do not support SSSE3), a variant using only SSE2 instructions exists.
SSE2 is enabled by default on x86_64 CPUs with 64-bit operating systems
(and is also automatically enabled by the -enable-ssse3 flag).
When running on x86_64 CPUs with 32-bit operating systems, these faster
2-byte swapping algorithms are not used by default in CFITSIO, but can be
enabled explicitly with:

<P>
<PRE>
./configure --enable-sse2
</PRE>
Preliminary testing indicates that these SSSE3 and SSE2 based
byte-swapping algorithms can boost the CFITSIO performance when
reading or writing FITS images by 20% - 30% or more.
It is important to note, however, that compiler optimization must be
turned on (e.g., by using the -O1 or -O2 flags in gcc) when building
programs that use these fast byte-swapping algorithms in order
to reap the full benefit of the SSSE3 and SSE2 instructions; without
optimization, the code may actually run slower than when using
more traditional byte-swapping techniques.

<P>
2.  When dealing with a FITS primary array or IMAGE extension, it is
more efficient to read or write large chunks of the  image at a time
(at least 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes) so that the direct IO mechanism
will be used as described in the previous section.  Smaller chunks of
data are read or written via the IO buffers, which is somewhat less
efficient because of the extra copy operation and additional
bookkeeping steps that are required.  In principle it is more efficient
to read or write as big an array of image pixels at one time as
possible, however, if the array becomes so large that the operating
system cannot store it all in RAM, then the performance may be degraded
because of the increased swapping of virtual memory to disk.

<P>
3.  When dealing with FITS tables, the most important efficiency factor
in the software design is to read or write the data in the FITS file in
a single pass through the file.  An example of poor program design
would be to read a large, 3-column table by sequentially reading the
entire first column, then going back to read the 2nd column, and
finally the 3rd column; this obviously requires 3 passes through the
file which could triple the execution time of an IO limited program.
For small tables this is not important, but when reading multi-megabyte
sized tables these inefficiencies can become significant.  The more
efficient procedure in this case is to read or write only as many rows
of the table as will fit into the available internal IO buffers, then
access all the necessary columns of data within that range of rows.
Then after the program is completely finished with the data in those
rows it can move on to the next range of rows that will fit in the
buffers, continuing in this way until the entire file has been
processed.  By using this procedure of accessing all the columns of a
table in parallel rather than sequentially, each block of the FITS file
will only be read or written once.

<P>
The optimal number of rows to read or write at one time in a given
table depends on the width of the table row and on the number of IO
buffers that have been allocated in CFITSIO.  The CFITSIO Iterator routine
will automatically use the optimal-sized buffer, but there is also a
CFITSIO routine that will return the optimal number of rows for a given
table:  fits_get_rowsize.  It is not critical to use exactly the
value of nrows returned by this routine, as long as one does not exceed
it.  Using a very small value however can also lead to poor performance
because of the overhead from the larger number of subroutine calls.

<P>
The optimal number of rows returned by fits_get_rowsize is valid only
as long as the application program is only reading or writing data in
the specified table.  Any other calls to access data in the table
header would  cause additional blocks of data
to be loaded into the IO buffers displacing data from the original
table, and should be avoided during the critical period while the table
is being read or written.

<P>
4.  Use the CFITSIO Iterator routine.  This routine provides a
more `object oriented' way of reading and writing FITS files
which automatically uses the most appropriate data buffer size
to achieve the maximum I/O throughput.

<P>
5.  Use binary table extensions rather than ASCII table
extensions for better efficiency  when dealing with tabular data.  The
I/O to ASCII tables is slower because of the overhead in formatting or
parsing the ASCII data fields and because ASCII tables are about twice
as large as binary tables that have the same information content.

<P>
6. Design software so that it reads the FITS header keywords in the
same order in which they occur in the file.  When reading keywords,
CFITSIO searches forward starting from the position of the last keyword
that was read.  If it reaches the end of the header without finding the
keyword, it then goes back to the start of the header and continues the
search down to the position where it started.  In practice, as long as
the entire FITS header can fit at one time in the available internal IO
buffers, then the header keyword access will be relatively fast and it makes
little difference which order they are accessed.

<P>
7. Avoid the use of scaling (by using the BSCALE and BZERO or TSCAL and
TZERO keywords) in FITS files since the scaling operations add to the
processing time needed to read or write the data.  In some cases it may
be more efficient to temporarily turn off the scaling (using fits_set_bscale or
fits_set_tscale) and then read or write the raw unscaled values in the FITS
file.

<P>
8. Avoid using the `implicit data type conversion' capability in
CFITSIO.  For instance, when reading a FITS image with BITPIX = -32
(32-bit floating point pixels), read the data into a single precision
floating point data array in the program.  Forcing CFITSIO to convert
the data to a different data type can slow the program.

<P>
9. Where feasible, design FITS binary tables using vector column
elements so that the data are written as a contiguous set of bytes,
rather than as single elements in multiple rows.  For example, it is
faster to access the data in a table that contains a single row
and 2 columns with TFORM keywords equal to  '10000E' and '10000J', than
it is to access the same amount of data in a table with 10000 rows
which has columns with the TFORM keywords equal to '1E' and '1J'.  In
the former case the 10000 floating point values in the first column are
all written in a contiguous block of the file which can be read or
written quickly, whereas in the second case each floating point value
in the first column is interleaved with the integer value in the second
column of the same row so CFITSIO has to explicitly move to the
position of each element to be read or written.

<P>
10. Avoid the use of variable length vector columns in binary tables,
since any reading or writing of these data requires that CFITSIO first
look up or compute the starting address of each row of data in the
heap.  In practice, this is probably not a significant efficiency issue.

<P>
11. When copying data from one FITS table to another, it is faster to
transfer the raw bytes instead of reading then writing each column of
the table.  The CFITSIO routines fits_read_tblbytes and
fits_write_tblbytes will perform low-level reads or writes of any
contiguous range of bytes in a table extension.  These routines can be
used to read or write a whole row (or multiple rows  for even greater
efficiency) of a table with a single function call.   These routines
are fast because they bypass all the usual data scaling, error checking
and machine dependent data conversion that is normally done by CFITSIO,
and they allow the program to write the data to the output file in
exactly the same byte order.  For these same reasons, these routines
can corrupt the FITS data file if used incorrectly because no
validation or machine dependent conversion is performed by these
routines.  These routines are only recommended for optimizing critical
pieces of code and should only be used by programmers who thoroughly
understand the internal format of the FITS tables they are reading or
writing.

<P>
12. Another strategy for improving the speed of writing a FITS table,
similar to the previous one, is to directly construct the entire byte
stream for a whole table row (or multiple rows) within the application
program and then write it to the FITS file with
fits_write_tblbytes.  This avoids all the overhead normally present
in the column-oriented CFITSIO write routines.  This technique should
only be used for critical applications because it makes the code more
difficult to understand and maintain, and it makes the code more system
dependent (e.g., do the bytes need to be swapped before writing to the
FITS file?).

<P>
13.  Finally, external factors such as the speed of the data storage device,
the size of the data cache, the amount of disk fragmentation, and the amount of
RAM available on the system can all have a significant impact on
overall I/O efficiency.  For critical applications, the entire hardware
and software system should be reviewed to identify any
potential I/O bottlenecks.
