10.11.1 General Syntax</A>
</H2>

<P>
The row filtering  expression can be an arbitrarily  complex series
    of operations performed  on constants,  keyword values,  and column
    data taken from the specified FITS TABLE extension.  The expression
    must evaluate to a boolean  value for each row  of the table, where
    a value of FALSE means that the row will be excluded.

<P>
For complex or commonly  used filters, one can place the expression
    into a text file and import it into the row filter using the syntax
    '[@filename.txt]'.  The expression can be  arbitrarily complex and
    extend over multiple lines of the file.  Any lines in the external
    text file that begin with 2 slash characters ('//') will be ignored
    and may be used to add comments into the file.

<P>
Keyword and   column data  are referenced by   name.  Any  string of
    characters not surrounded by    quotes (ie, a constant  string)   or
    followed by   an open parentheses (ie,   a  function name)   will be
    initially interpreted   as a column  name and  its contents for the
    current row inserted into the expression.  If no such column exists,
    a keyword of that  name will be searched for  and its value used, if
    found.  To force the  name to be  interpreted as a keyword (in case
    there is both a column and keyword with the  same name), precede the
    keyword name with a single pound sign, '#', as in '#NAXIS2'.  Due to
    the generalities of FITS column and  keyword names, if the column or
    keyword name  contains a space or a  character which might appear as
    an arithmetic  term then enclose  the  name in '$'  characters as in
    $MAX PHA$ or #$MAX-PHA$.  Names are case insensitive.

<P>
To access a table entry in a row other  than the current one, follow
    the  column's name  with  a row  offset  within  curly  braces.  For
    example, 'PHA{-3}' will evaluate to the value  of column PHA, 3 rows
    above  the  row currently  being processed.   One  cannot specify an
    absolute row number, only a relative offset.  Rows that fall outside
    the table will be treated as undefined, or NULLs.

<P>
Boolean   operators can be  used in  the expression  in either their
    Fortran or C forms.  The following boolean operators are available:

<P>
<PRE>
    "equal"         .eq. .EQ. ==  "not equal"          .ne.  .NE.  !=
    "less than"     .lt. .LT. &lt;   "less than/equal"    .le.  .LE.  &lt;= =&lt;
    "greater than"  .gt. .GT. &gt;   "greater than/equal" .ge.  .GE.  &gt;= =&gt;
    "or"            .or. .OR. ||  "and"                .and. .AND. &amp;&amp;
    "negation"     .not. .NOT. !  "approx. equal(1e-7)"  ~
</PRE>

<P>
Note  that the exclamation
point,  '!', is a special UNIX character, so if it is used  on the
command line rather than entered at a task prompt, it must be  preceded
by a backslash to force the UNIX shell to ignore it.

<P>
The expression may  also include arithmetic operators and functions.
    Trigonometric  functions use  radians,  not degrees.  The  following
    arithmetic  operators and  functions  can be  used in the expression
    (function names are case insensitive). A null value will be returned
    in case of illegal operations such as divide by zero, sqrt(negative)
    log(negative), log10(negative), arccos(.gt. 1), arcsin(.gt. 1).

<P>
<PRE>
    "addition"          +          "subtraction"          -
    "multiplication"    *          "division"             /
    "negation"          -          "exponentiation"       **   ^
    "absolute value"    abs(x)     "cosine"                cos(x)
    "sine"              sin(x)     "tangent"               tan(x)
    "arc cosine"        arccos(x)  "arc sine"              arcsin(x)
    "arc tangent"       arctan(x)  "arc tangent"           arctan2(y,x)
    "hyperbolic cos"    cosh(x)    "hyperbolic sin"        sinh(x)
    "hyperbolic tan"    tanh(x)    "round to nearest int"  round(x)
    "round down to int" floor(x)   "round up to int"       ceil(x)
    "exponential"       exp(x)     "square root"           sqrt(x)
    "natural log"       log(x)     "common log"            log10(x)
    "modulus"           x % y      "random # [0.0,1.0)"    random()
    "random Gaussian"   randomn()  "random Poisson"        randomp(x)
    "minimum"           min(x,y)   "maximum"               max(x,y)
    "cumulative sum"    accum(x)   "sequential difference" seqdiff(x)
    "if-then-else"      b?x:y
    "angular separation"  angsep(ra1,dec1,ra2,de2) (all in degrees)
    "substring"      strmid(s,p,n) "string search"         strstr(s,r)
</PRE>
Three different random number functions are provided:  random(), with
no arguments, produces a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1;
randomn(), also with no arguments, produces a normal (Gaussian) random
deviate  with zero mean and unit standard deviation; randomp(x)
produces a Poisson random deviate whose expected number of counts is
X.  X may be any positive real number of expected counts, including
fractional values, but the return value is an integer.

<P>
When the random functions are used in a vector expression, by default
the same random value will be used when evaluating each element of the vector.
If different random numbers are desired, then the name of a vector
column should be supplied as the single argument to the random
function (e.g., "flux + 0.1 * random(flux)", where "flux' is the
name of a vector column).  This will create a vector of
random numbers that will be used in sequence when evaluating each
element of the vector expression.

<P>
An alternate syntax for the min and max functions  has only a single
argument which  should be  a  vector value (see  below).  The result
will be the minimum/maximum element contained within the vector.

<P>
The accum(x) function forms the cumulative sum of x, element by element.
Vector columns are supported simply by performing the summation process
through all the values.  Null values are treated as 0.  The seqdiff(x)
function forms the sequential difference of x, element by element.
The first value of seqdiff is the first value of x.  A single null
value in x causes a pair of nulls in the output.  The seqdiff and
accum functions are functional inverses, i.e., seqdiff(accum(x)) == x
as long as no null values are present.

<P>
In the if-then-else expression, "b?x:y", b is an explicit boolean
value or expression.  There is no automatic type conversion from
numeric to boolean values, so one needs to use "iVal!=0" instead of
merely "iVal" as the boolean argument. x and y can be any scalar data
type (including string).

<P>
The angsep function computes the angular separation in degrees
between 2 celestial positions, where the first 2 parameters
give the RA-like and Dec-like coordinates (in decimal degrees)
of the first position, and the 3rd and 4th parameters give the
coordinates of the second position.

<P>
The substring function strmid(S,P,N) extracts a substring from S,
starting at string position P, with a substring length N.  The first
character position in S is labeled as 1. If P is 0, or refers to a
position beyond the end of S, then the extracted substring will be
NULL.  S, P, and N may be functions of other columns.

<P>
The string search function strstr(S,R) searches for the first occurrence
of the substring R in S.  The result is an integer, indicating the
character position of the first match (where 1 is the first character
position of S).  If no match is found, then strstr() returns a NULL
value.

<P>
The  following  type  casting  operators  are  available,  where the
inclosing parentheses are required and taken  from  the  C  language
usage. Also, the integer to real casts values to double precision:

<P>
<PRE>
                "real to integer"    (int) x     (INT) x
                "integer to real"    (float) i   (FLOAT) i
</PRE>

<P>
In addition, several constants are built in  for  use  in  numerical
    expressions:

<P>
<PRE>
        #pi              3.1415...      #e             2.7182...
        #deg             #pi/180        #row           current row number
        #null         undefined value   #snull         undefined string
</PRE>

<P>
A  string constant must  be enclosed  in quotes  as in  'Crab'.  The
    "null" constants  are useful for conditionally  setting table values
    to a NULL, or undefined, value (eg., "col1==-99 ? #NULL : col1").

<P>
There is also a function for testing if  two  values  are  close  to
    each  other,  i.e.,  if  they are "near" each other to within a user
    specified tolerance. The  arguments,  value_1  and  value_2  can  be
    integer  or  real  and  represent  the two values who's proximity is
    being tested to be within the specified tolerance, also  an  integer
    or real:

<P>
<PRE>
                    near(value_1, value_2, tolerance)
</PRE>
    When  a  NULL, or undefined, value is encountered in the FITS table,
    the expression will evaluate to NULL unless the undefined  value  is
    not   actually   required  for  evaluation,  e.g. "TRUE  .or.  NULL"
    evaluates to TRUE. The  following  two  functions  allow  some  NULL
    detection  and  handling:

<P>
<PRE>
         "a null value?"              ISNULL(x)
         "define a value for null"    DEFNULL(x,y)
</PRE>
    The former
    returns a boolean value of TRUE if the  argument  x  is  NULL.   The
    later  "defines"  a  value  to  be  substituted  for NULL values; it
    returns the value of x if x is not NULL, otherwise  it  returns  the
    value of y.

<P>
