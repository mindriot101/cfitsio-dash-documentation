5.2 FITS File Access Routines</A>
</H1>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>1 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Open an existing data file. <A NAME="ffopen"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
int fits_open_file / ffopen
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, int iomode, &gt; int *status)

int fits_open_diskfile / ffdkopen
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, int iomode, &gt; int *status)

int fits_open_data / ffdopn
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, int iomode, &gt; int *status)

int fits_open_table / fftopn
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, int iomode, &gt; int *status)

int fits_open_image / ffiopn
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, int iomode, &gt; int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
The iomode parameter determines the read/write access allowed in the
file and can have values of READONLY (0) or READWRITE (1). The filename
parameter gives the name of the file to be opened, followed by an
optional argument giving the name or index number of the extension
within the FITS file that should be moved to and opened (e.g.,
<code>myfile.fits+3</code> or <code>myfile.fits[3]</code> moves to the 3rd extension within
the file, and <code>myfile.fits[events]</code> moves to the extension with the
keyword EXTNAME = 'EVENTS').

<P>
The fits_open_diskfile routine is similar to the fits_open_file routine
except that it does not support the extended filename syntax in the input
file name.  This routine simply tries to open the specified input file
on magnetic disk.  This routine is mainly for use in cases where the
filename (or directory path) contains square or curly bracket characters
that would confuse the extended filename parser.

<P>
The fits_open_data routine is similar to the fits_open_file routine
except that it will move to the first HDU containing significant data,
if a HDU name or number to open was not explicitly specified as
part of the filename.  In this case, it will look for the first
IMAGE HDU with NAXIS greater than 0, or the first table that does not contain the
strings `GTI' (Good Time Interval extension) or `OBSTABLE' in the
EXTNAME keyword value.

<P>
The fits_open_table and fits_open_image routines are similar to
fits_open_data except they will move to the first significant table
HDU or image HDU in the file, respectively, if a HDU name or
number is not specified as part of the filename.

<P>
IRAF images (.imh format files) and raw binary data arrays may also be
opened with READONLY access.  CFITSIO will automatically test if the
input file is an IRAF image, and if, so will convert it on the fly into
a virtual FITS image before it is opened by the application program.
If the input file is a raw binary data array of numbers, then the data type
and dimensions of the array must be specified in square brackets
following the name of the file (e.g.  'rawfile.dat[i512,512]' opens a
512 x 512 short integer image).  See the `Extended File Name Syntax'
chapter for more details on how to specify the raw file name.  The raw
file is converted on the fly into a virtual FITS image in memory that
is then opened by the application program with READONLY access.

<P>
Programs can read the input file from the 'stdin' file stream if a dash
character ('-') is given as the filename. Files can also be opened over
the network using FTP or HTTP protocols by supplying the appropriate URL
as the filename.

<P>
The input file can be modified in various ways to create a virtual file
(usually stored in memory) that is then opened by the application
program by supplying a filtering or binning specifier in square brackets
following the filename. Some of the more common filtering methods are
illustrated in the following paragraphs, but users should refer to the
'Extended File Name Syntax' chapter for a complete description of
the full file filtering syntax.

<P>
When opening an image, a rectangular subset of the physical image may be
opened by listing the first and last pixel in each dimension (and
optional pixel skipping factor):

<P>
<PRE>
myimage.fits[101:200,301:400]
</PRE>
will create and open a 100x100 pixel virtual image of that section of
the physical image, and <code>myimage.fits[*,-*]</code> opens a virtual image
that is the same size as the physical image but has been flipped in
the vertical direction.

<P>
When opening a table, the filtering syntax can be used to add or delete
columns or keywords in the virtual table:
<code>myfile.fits[events][col !time; PI = PHA*1.2]</code> opens a virtual table in which the TIME column
has been deleted and a new PI column has been added with a value 1.2
times that of the PHA column. Similarly, one can filter a table to keep
only those rows that satisfy a selection criterion:
<code>myfile.fits[events][pha &gt; 50]</code> creates and opens a virtual table
containing only those rows with a PHA value greater than 50. A large
number of boolean and mathematical operators can be used in the
selection expression. One can also filter table rows using 'Good Time
Interval' extensions, and spatial region filters as in
<code>myfile.fits[events][gtifilter()]</code> and
<code>myfile.fits[events][regfilter( "stars.rng")]</code>.

<P>
Finally, table columns may be binned or histogrammed to generate a
virtual image. For example, <code>myfile.fits[events][bin (X,Y)=4]</code> will
result in a 2-dimensional image calculated by binning the X and Y
columns in the event table with a bin size of 4 in each dimension. The
TLMINn and TLMAXn keywords will be used by default to determine the
range of the image.

<P>
A single program can open the same FITS file more than once and then
treat the resulting fitsfile pointers as though they were completely
independent FITS files. Using this facility, a program can open a FITS
file twice, move to 2 different extensions within the file, and then
 read and write data in those extensions in any order.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>2 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Create and open a new empty output FITS file. <A NAME="ffinit"></A>
<P>
<PRE>
int fits_create_file / ffinit
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, &gt; int *status)

int fits_create_diskfile / ffdkinit
    (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, &gt; int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
An error will be returned if the specified file already exists, unless
the filename is prefixed with an exclamation point (!). In that case
CFITSIO will overwrite (delete) any existing file with the same name.
Note that the exclamation point is a special UNIX character so if
it is used on the command line it must be preceded by a backslash to
force the UNIX shell to accept the character as part of the filename.

<P>
The output file will be written to the 'stdout' file stream if a dash
character ('-') or the string 'stdout' is given as the filename. Similarly,
'-.gz' or 'stdout.gz' will cause the file to be gzip compressed before
it is written out to the stdout stream.

<P>
Optionally, the name of a template file that is used to define the
structure of the new file may be specified in parentheses following the
output file name. The template file may be another FITS file, in which
case the new file, at the time it is opened, will be an exact copy of
the template file except that the data structures (images and tables)
will be filled with zeros. Alternatively, the template file may be an
ASCII format text file containing directives that define the keywords to be
created in each HDU of the file. See the 'Extended File Name Syntax'
 section for a complete description of the template file syntax.

<P>
The fits_create_diskfile routine is similar to the fits_create_file routine
except that it does not support the extended filename syntax in the input
file name.  This routine simply tries to create the specified file
on magnetic disk.  This routine is mainly for use in cases where the
filename (or directory path) contains square or curly bracket characters
 that would confuse the extended filename parser.

<DT><STRONG>3 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Close a previously opened FITS file.  The first routine simply
closes the file, whereas the second one also DELETES THE FILE, which
can be useful in cases where a FITS file has been partially created,
but then an error occurs which prevents it from being completed.
 <A NAME="ffclos"></A> <A NAME="ffdelt"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_close_file / ffclos (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; int *status)

  int fits_delete_file / ffdelt (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>4 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Return the name, I/O mode (READONLY or READWRITE), and/or the file
type (e.g. 'file://', 'ftp://') of the opened FITS file. <A NAME="ffflnm"></A> <A NAME="ffflmd"></A> <A NAME="ffurlt"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_file_name / ffflnm (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; char *filename, int *status)

  int fits_file_mode / ffflmd (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; int *iomode, int *status)

  int fits_url_type / ffurlt (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; char *urltype, int *status)
</PRE>
