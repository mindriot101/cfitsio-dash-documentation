13.1 How CFITSIO Manages Data I/O</A>
</H1>

<P>
Many CFITSIO operations involve transferring only a small number of
bytes to or from the FITS file (e.g, reading a keyword, or writing a
row in a table); it would be very inefficient to physically read or
write such small blocks of data directly in the FITS file on disk,
therefore CFITSIO maintains a set of internal Input-Output (IO)
buffers in RAM memory that each contain one FITS block (2880 bytes) of
data.  Whenever CFITSIO needs to access data in the FITS file, it first
transfers the FITS block containing those bytes into one of the IO
buffers in memory.  The next time CFITSIO needs to access bytes in the
same block it can then go to the fast IO buffer rather than using a
much slower system disk access routine.  The number of available IO
buffers is determined by the NIOBUF parameter (in fitsio2.h) and is
currently set to 40 by default.

<P>
Whenever CFITSIO reads or writes data it first checks to see if that
block of the FITS file is already loaded into one of the IO buffers.
If not, and if there is an empty IO buffer available, then it will load
that block into the IO buffer (when reading a FITS file) or will
initialize a new block (when writing to a FITS file).  If all the IO
buffers are already full, it must decide which one to reuse (generally
the one that has been accessed least recently), and flush the contents
back to disk if it has been modified before loading the new block.

<P>
The one major exception to the above process occurs whenever a large
contiguous set of bytes are accessed, as might occur when reading or
writing a FITS image.  In this case CFITSIO bypasses the internal IO
buffers and simply reads or writes the desired bytes directly in the
disk file with a single call to a low-level file read or write
routine.  The minimum threshold for the number of bytes to read or
write this way is set by the MINDIRECT parameter and is currently set
to 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes.  This is the most efficient way to read
or write large chunks of data and can achieve IO transfer rates of
5 - 10MB/s or greater.  Note that this fast direct IO process is not
applicable when accessing columns of data in a FITS table because the
bytes are generally not contiguous since they are interleaved by the
other columns of data in the table.  This explains why the speed for
accessing FITS tables is generally slower than accessing
FITS images.

<P>
Given this background information, the general strategy for efficiently
accessing FITS files should be apparent:  when dealing with FITS
images, read or write large chunks of data at a time so that the direct
IO mechanism will be invoked;  when accessing FITS headers or FITS
tables, on the other hand, once a particular FITS block has been
loading into one of the IO buffers, try to access all the needed
information in that block before it gets flushed out of the IO buffer.
It is important to avoid the situation where the same FITS block is
being read then flushed from a IO buffer multiple times.

<P>
The following section gives more specific suggestions for optimizing
the use of CFITSIO.
