10.11.5 Spatial Region Filtering</A>
</H2>

<P>
Another common  filtering method selects rows based on whether the
    spatial position associated with each row is located within a given
    2-dimensional region.  The syntax for this high-level filter is

<P>
<PRE>
       regfilter( "regfilename" [ , Xexpr, Yexpr [ , "wcs cols" ] ] )
</PRE>
    where each "[]" demarks optional parameters. The region file name
    is required and must be  enclosed in quotes.  The remaining
    parameters are optional.  There are 2 supported formats for the
    region file: ASCII file or FITS binary table.  The region file
    contains a list of one or more geometric shapes (circle,
    ellipse, box, etc.) which defines a region on the celestial sphere
    or an area within a particular 2D image.  The region file is
    typically generated using an image display program such as fv/POW
    (distribute by the HEASARC), or ds9 (distributed by the Smithsonian
    Astrophysical Observatory).  Users should refer to the documentation
    provided with these programs for more details on the syntax used in
    the region files.  The FITS region file format is defined in a document
    available from the FITS Support Office at
    http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/ registry/ region.html

<P>
In its simplest form, (e.g., regfilter("region.reg") ) the
    coordinates in the default 'X' and 'Y' columns will be used to
    determine if each row is inside or outside the area specified in
    the region file.  Alternate position column names, or expressions,
    may be entered if needed, as in

<P>
<PRE>
        regfilter("region.reg", XPOS, YPOS)
</PRE>
    Region filtering can be applied most unambiguously if the positions
    in the region file and in the table to be filtered are both give in
    terms of absolute celestial coordinate units.  In this case the
    locations and sizes of the geometric shapes in the region file are
    specified in angular units on the sky (e.g., positions given in
    R.A. and Dec.  and sizes in arcseconds or arcminutes).  Similarly,
    each row of the filtered table will have a celestial coordinate
    associated with it.  This association is usually implemented using
    a set of so-called 'World Coordinate System' (or WCS) FITS keywords
    that define the coordinate transformation that must be applied to
    the values in the 'X' and 'Y' columns to calculate the coordinate.

<P>
Alternatively, one can perform spatial filtering using unitless
    'pixel' coordinates for the regions and row positions.  In this
    case the user must be careful to ensure that the positions in the 2
    files are self-consistent.  A typical problem is that the region
    file may be generated using a binned image, but the unbinned
    coordinates are given in the event table.  The ROSAT events files,
    for example, have X and Y pixel coordinates that range from 1 -
    15360.  These coordinates are typically binned by a factor of 32 to
    produce a 480x480 pixel image.  If one then uses a region file
    generated from this image (in image pixel units) to filter the
    ROSAT events file, then the X and Y column values must be converted
    to corresponding pixel units as in:

<P>
<PRE>
        regfilter("rosat.reg", X/32.+.5, Y/32.+.5)
</PRE>
    Note that this binning conversion is not necessary if the region
    file is specified using celestial coordinate units instead of pixel
    units because CFITSIO is then able to directly compare the
    celestial coordinate of each row in the table with the celestial
    coordinates in the region file without having to know anything
    about how the image may have been binned.

<P>
The last "wcs cols" parameter should rarely be needed. If supplied,
    this  string contains the names of the 2 columns (space or comma
    separated) which have the associated WCS keywords. If not supplied,
    the filter  will scan the X  and Y expressions for column names.
    If only one is found in each  expression, those columns will be
    used, otherwise an error will be returned.

<P>
These region shapes are supported (names are case insensitive):

<P>
<PRE>
       Point         ( X1, Y1 )               &lt;- One pixel square region
       Line          ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2 )       &lt;- One pixel wide region
       Polygon       ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2, ... )  &lt;- Rest are interiors with
       Rectangle     ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2, A )       | boundaries considered
       Box           ( Xc, Yc, Wdth, Hght, A )   V within the region
       Diamond       ( Xc, Yc, Wdth, Hght, A )
       Circle        ( Xc, Yc, R )
       Annulus       ( Xc, Yc, Rin, Rout )
       Ellipse       ( Xc, Yc, Rx, Ry, A )
       Elliptannulus ( Xc, Yc, Rinx, Riny, Routx, Routy, Ain, Aout )
       Sector        ( Xc, Yc, Amin, Amax )
</PRE>
    where (Xc,Yc) is  the coordinate of  the shape's center; (X#,Y#) are
    the coordinates  of the shape's edges;  Rxxx are the shapes' various
    Radii or semimajor/minor  axes; and Axxx  are the angles of rotation
    (or bounding angles for Sector) in degrees.  For rotated shapes, the
    rotation angle  can  be left  off, indicating  no rotation.   Common
    alternate  names for the regions  can also be  used: rotbox = box;
    rotrectangle = rectangle;  (rot)rhombus = (rot)diamond;  and pie
    = sector.  When a  shape's name is  preceded by a minus sign, '-',
    the defined region  is instead the area  *outside* its boundary (ie,
    the region is inverted).  All the shapes within a single region
    file are OR'd together to create the region, and the order is
    significant. The overall way of looking at region files is that if
    the first region is an excluded region then a dummy included region
    of the whole detector is inserted in the front. Then each region
    specification as it is processed overrides any selections inside of
    that region specified by previous regions. Another way of thinking
    about this is that if a previous excluded region is completely
    inside of a subsequent included region the excluded region is
    ignored.

<P>
The positional coordinates may be given either in pixel units,
    decimal degrees or hh:mm:ss.s, dd:mm:ss.s units.  The shape sizes
    may be given in pixels, degrees, arcminutes, or arcseconds.  Look
    at examples of region file produced by fv/POW or ds9 for further
    details of the region file format.

<P>
There are three low-level  functions that are primarily for use with
    regfilter function, but they  can  be  called  directly.  They
    return  a  boolean true   or  false  depending   on  whether a   two
    dimensional point is in the region or not.  The positional coordinates
    must be given in pixel units:

<P>
<PRE>
    "point in a circular region"
          circle(xcntr,ycntr,radius,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)

    "point in an elliptical region"
         ellipse(xcntr,ycntr,xhlf_wdth,yhlf_wdth,rotation,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)

    "point in a rectangular region"
             box(xcntr,ycntr,xfll_wdth,yfll_wdth,rotation,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)

    where
       (xcntr,ycntr) are the (x,y) position of the center of the region
       (xhlf_wdth,yhlf_wdth) are the (x,y) half widths of the region
       (xfll_wdth,yfll_wdth) are the (x,y) full widths of the region
       (radius) is half the diameter of the circle
       (rotation) is the angle(degrees) that the region is rotated with
             respect to (xcntr,ycntr)
       (Xcoord,Ycoord) are the (x,y) coordinates to test, usually column
             names
       NOTE: each parameter can itself be an expression, not merely a
             column name or constant.
