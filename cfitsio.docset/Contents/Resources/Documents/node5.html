<P>
The development of the many powerful features in CFITSIO was made
possible through collaborations with many people or organizations from
around the world.  The following in particular have made especially
significant contributions:

<P>
Programmers from the Integral Science Data Center, Switzerland (namely,
Jurek Borkowski, Bruce O'Neel, and Don Jennings), designed the concept
for the plug-in I/O drivers that was introduced with CFITSIO 2.0.  The
use of `drivers' greatly simplified  the low-level I/O, which in turn
made other new features in CFITSIO (e.g., support for compressed FITS
files and support for IRAF format image files) much easier to
implement.  Jurek Borkowski wrote the Shared Memory driver, and Bruce
O'Neel wrote the drivers for accessing FITS files over the network
using the FTP, HTTP, and ROOT protocols.  Also, in 2009, Bruce O'Neel
was the key developer of the thread-safe version of CFITSIO.

<P>
The ISDC also provided the template parsing routines (written by Jurek
Borkowski) and the hierarchical grouping routines (written by Don
Jennings).  The ISDC DAL (Data Access Layer) routines are layered on
top of CFITSIO and make extensive use of these features.

<P>
Giuliano Taffoni and Andrea Barisani, at INAF, University of Trieste,
Italy, implemented the I/O driver routines for accessing FITS files
on the computational grids using the gridftp protocol.

<P>
Uwe Lammers (XMM/ESA/ESTEC, The Netherlands) designed the
high-performance lexical parsing algorithm that is used to do
on-the-fly filtering of FITS tables.  This algorithm essentially
pre-compiles the user-supplied selection expression into a form that
can be rapidly evaluated for each row.  Peter Wilson (RSTX, NASA/GSFC)
then wrote the parsing routines used by CFITSIO based on Lammers'
design, combined with other techniques such as the CFITSIO iterator
routine to further enhance the data processing throughput.  This effort
also benefited from a much earlier lexical parsing routine that was
developed by Kent Blackburn (NASA/GSFC). More recently, Craig Markwardt
(NASA/GSFC) implemented additional functions (median, average, stddev)
and other enhancements to the lexical parser.

<P>
The CFITSIO iterator function is loosely based on similar ideas
developed for the XMM Data Access Layer.

<P>
Peter Wilson (RSTX, NASA/GSFC) wrote the complete set of
Fortran-callable wrappers for all the CFITSIO routines, which in turn
rely on the CFORTRAN macro developed by Burkhard Burow.

<P>
The syntax used by CFITSIO for filtering or binning input FITS files is
based on ideas developed for the AXAF Science Center Data Model by
Jonathan McDowell, Antonella Fruscione, Aneta Siemiginowska and Bill
Joye. See http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/axaf7.html for
further description of the AXAF Data Model.

<P>
The file decompression code were taken directly from the gzip (GNU zip)
program developed by Jean-loup Gailly and others.

<P>
The new compressed image data format (where the image is tiled and
the compressed byte stream from each tile is stored in a binary table)
was implemented in collaboration with Richard White (STScI), Perry
Greenfield (STScI) and Doug Tody (NOAO).

<P>
Doug Mink (SAO) provided the routines for converting IRAF format
images into FITS format.

<P>
Martin Reinecke (Max Planck Institute, Garching)) provided the modifications to
cfortran.h that are necessary to support 64-bit integer values when calling
C routines from fortran programs.  The cfortran.h macros were originally developed
by Burkhard Burow (CERN).

<P>
Julian Taylor (ESO, Garching) provided the fast byte-swapping algorithms
that use the SSE2 and SSSE3 machine instructions available on x86_64 CPUs.

<P>
In addition, many other people have made valuable contributions to the
development of CFITSIO.  These include (with apologies to others that may
have inadvertently been omitted):

<P>
Steve Allen, Carl Akerlof, Keith Arnaud, Morten Krabbe Barfoed, Kent
Blackburn, G Bodammer, Romke Bontekoe, Lucio Chiappetti, Keith Costorf,
Robin Corbet, John Davis,  Richard Fink, Ning Gan, Emily Greene, Gretchen
Green, Joe Harrington, Cheng Ho, Phil Hodge, Jim Ingham, Yoshitaka
Ishisaki, Diab Jerius, Mark Levine, Todd Karakaskian, Edward King,
Scott Koch,  Claire Larkin, Rob Managan, Eric Mandel, Richard Mathar,
John Mattox, Carsten Meyer, Emi Miyata, Stefan Mochnacki, Mike Noble,
Oliver Oberdorf, Clive Page, Arvind Parmar, Jeff Pedelty, Tim Pearson,
Philippe Prugniel, Maren Purves, Scott Randall, Chris Rogers, Arnold Rots,
Rob Seaman, Barry Schlesinger, Robin Stebbins, Andrew Szymkowiak, Allyn Tennant,
Peter Teuben, James Theiler, Doug Tody, Shiro Ueno, Steve Walton, Archie
Warnock, Alan Watson, Dan Whipple, Wim Wimmers, Peter Young, Jianjun Xu,
and Nelson Zarate.
