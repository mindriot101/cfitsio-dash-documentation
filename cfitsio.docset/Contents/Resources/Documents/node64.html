9.1 FITS File Access Routines</A>

<DD>Open an existing FITS file residing in core computer memory.  This
routine is analogous to fits_open_file.   The 'filename'  is
currently ignored by this routine and may be any arbitrary string. In
general, the application must have preallocated an initial block of
memory to hold the FITS file prior to calling this routine:  'memptr'
points to the starting address and 'memsize' gives the initial size of
the block of memory.  'mem_realloc' is a pointer to an optional
function that CFITSIO can call to allocate additional memory, if needed
(only if mode = READWRITE), and is modeled after the standard C
'realloc' function;  a null pointer may be given if the initial
allocation of memory is all that will be required (e.g., if the file is
opened with mode = READONLY).  The 'deltasize' parameter may be used to
suggest a minimum amount of additional memory that should be allocated
during each call to the memory reallocation function.  By default,
CFITSIO will reallocate enough additional space to hold the entire
currently defined FITS file (as given by the NAXISn keywords) or 1 FITS
block (= 2880 bytes), which ever is larger.  Values of deltasize less
than 2880 will be ignored.  Since the memory reallocation operation can
be computationally expensive, allocating a larger initial block of
memory, and/or specifying a larger deltasize value may help to reduce
the number of reallocation calls and make the application program run
faster.  Note that values of the memptr and memsize pointers will be updated
by CFITSIO if the location or size of the FITS file in memory
should change as a result of allocating more memory. <A NAME="ffomem"></A></DD>

<DD>Create a new FITS file residing in core computer memory.  This
routine is analogous to fits_create_file.    In general, the
application must have preallocated an initial block of memory to hold
the FITS file prior to calling this routine:  'memptr' points to the
starting address and 'memsize' gives the initial size of the block of
memory.  'mem_realloc' is a pointer to an optional function that
CFITSIO can call to allocate additional memory, if needed, and is

and  values of deltasize less than 2880 will be ignored.  Since the

should change as a result of allocating more memory. <A NAME="ffimem"></A></DD>

  int fits_create_memfile / ffimem
      (fitsfile **fptr, void **memptr,

<DD>Reopen a FITS file that was previously opened with
    fits_open_file or fits_create_file.  The new fitsfile
    pointer may then be treated as a separate file, and one may
    simultaneously read or write to 2 (or more)  different extensions in
    the same file.   The fits_open_file routine (above) automatically
    detects cases where a previously opened file is being opened again,
    and then internally call fits_reopen_file, so programs should rarely
    need to explicitly call this routine.
<A NAME="ffreopen"></A></DD>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_reopen_file / ffreopen
      (fitsfile *openfptr, fitsfile **newfptr, &gt; int *status)
</PRE>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>4 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Create a new FITS file, using a template file to define its
  initial size and structure.  The template may be another FITS HDU
  or an ASCII template file.  If the input template file name pointer
  is null, then this routine behaves the same as fits_create_file.
  The currently supported format of the ASCII template file is described
  under the fits_parse_template routine (in the general Utilities
  section)
<A NAME="fftplt"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_create_template / fftplt
      (fitsfile **fptr, char *filename, char *tpltfile &gt; int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>5 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Parse the input filename or URL into its component parts, namely:

<UL>
<LI>the file type (file://, ftp://, http://, etc),
</LI>
<LI>the base input file name,
</LI>
<LI>the name of the output file that the input file is to be copied to prior
to opening,
</LI>
<LI>the HDU or extension specification,
</LI>
<LI>the filtering specifier,
</LI>
<LI>the binning specifier,
</LI>
<LI>the column specifier,
</LI>
<LI>and the
image pixel filtering specifier.
</LI>
</UL>
A null pointer (0) may be be specified for any of the output string arguments
that are not needed.  Null strings will be returned for any components that are not
present in the input file name.  The calling routine must allocate sufficient
memory to hold the returned character strings.  Allocating the string lengths
equal to FLEN_FILENAME is guaranteed to be safe.
These routines are mainly for internal use
by other CFITSIO routines. <A NAME="ffiurl"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_parse_input_url / ffiurl
      (char *filename, &gt; char *filetype, char *infile, char *outfile, char
       *extspec, char *filter, char *binspec, char *colspec, int *status)

  int fits_parse_input_filename / ffifile
      (char *filename, &gt; char *filetype, char *infile, char *outfile, char
       *extspec, char *filter, char *binspec, char *colspec, char *pixspec,
       int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>6 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Parse the input filename and return the HDU number that would be
moved to if the file were opened with fits_open_file.  The returned
HDU number begins with 1 for the primary array, so for example, if the
input filename = `myfile.fits[2]' then hdunum = 3 will be returned.
CFITSIO does not open the file to check if the extension actually
exists if an extension number is specified. If an extension name is
included in the file name specification (e.g.  `myfile.fits[EVENTS]'
then this routine will have to open the FITS file and look for the
position of the named extension, then close file again.  This is not
possible if the file is being read from the stdin stream, and an error
will be returned in this case.  If the filename does not specify an
explicit extension (e.g. 'myfile.fits') then hdunum = -99 will be
returned, which is functionally equivalent to hdunum = 1. This routine
is mainly used for backward compatibility in the ftools software
package and is not recommended for general use.  It is generally better
and more efficient to first open the FITS file with fits_open_file,
then use fits_get_hdu_num to determine which HDU in the file has
been opened, rather than calling fits_parse_input_url followed by a
call to fits_open_file.
 <A NAME="ffextn"></A></DD>

<PRE>
   int fits_parse_extnum / ffextn
       (char *filename, &gt; int *hdunum, int *status)
</PRE>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>7 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Parse the input file name and return the root file name.  The root
name includes the file type if specified, (e.g.  'ftp://' or 'http://')
and the full path name, to the extent that it is specified in the input
filename.  It does not include the HDU name or number, or any filtering
specifications. The calling routine must allocate sufficient
memory to hold the returned rootname character string.  Allocating the length
equal to FLEN_FILENAME is guaranteed to be safe.
 <A NAME="ffrtnm"></A></DD>

   int fits_parse_rootname / ffrtnm
       (char *filename, &gt; char *rootname, int *status);

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>8 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Test if the input file or a compressed version of the file (with
a .gz, .Z, .z, or .zip extension) exists on disk.  The returned value of
the 'exists' parameter will have 1 of the 4 following values:

<P>
<PRE>
   2:  the file does not exist, but a compressed version does exist
   1:  the disk file does exist
   0:  neither the file nor a compressed version of the file exist
  -1:  the input file name is not a disk file (could be a ftp, http,
       smem, or mem file, or a file piped in on the STDIN stream)
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="ffexist"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
   int fits_file_exists / ffexist
       (char *filename, &gt; int *exists, int *status);
</PRE>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>9 </STRONG></DT>
<DD>Flush any internal buffers of data to the output FITS file. These
   routines rarely need to be called, but can be useful in cases where
   other processes need to access the same FITS file in real time,
   either on disk or in memory.  These routines also help to ensure
   that if the application program subsequently aborts then the FITS
   file will have been closed properly.  The first routine,
   fits_flush_file is more rigorous and completely closes, then
   reopens, the current HDU, before flushing the internal buffers, thus
   ensuring that the output FITS file is identical to what would be
   produced if the FITS was closed at that point (i.e., with a call to
   fits_close_file).  The second routine, fits_flush_buffer simply
   flushes the internal CFITSIO buffers of data to the output FITS
   file, without updating and closing the current HDU.  This is much
   faster, but there may be circumstances where the flushed file does
   not completely reflect the final state of the file as it will exist
   when the file is actually closed.

<P>
A typical use of these routines would be to flush the state of a
   FITS table to disk after each row of the table is written.  It is
   recommend that fits_flush_file be called after the first row is
   written, then fits_flush_buffer may be called after each
   subsequent row is written.  Note that this latter routine will not
   automatically update the NAXIS2 keyword which records the number of
   rows of data in the table, so this keyword must be explicitly
   updated by the application program after each row is written.
  <A NAME="ffflus"></A></DD>
</DL>

<P>
<PRE>
  int fits_flush_file / ffflus
      (fitsfile *fptr, &gt; int *status)

  int fits_flush_buffer / ffflsh
      (fitsfile *fptr, 0, &gt; int *status)

      (Note:  The second argument must be 0).
