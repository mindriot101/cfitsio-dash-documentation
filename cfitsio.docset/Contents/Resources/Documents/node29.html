4.10 Variable-Length Arrays in Binary Tables</A>
</H1>

<P>
CFITSIO provides easy-to-use support for reading and writing data in
variable length fields of a binary table. The variable length columns
have TFORMn keyword values of the form `1Pt(len)' where `t' is the
data type code (e.g., I, J, E, D, etc.) and `len' is an integer
specifying the maximum length of the vector in the table.  (CFITSIO also
supports the experimental 'Q' datatype, which is identical to the 'P' type
except that is supports is a 64-bit address space and hence much larger
data structures).  If the value
of `len' is not specified when the table is created (e.g., if the TFORM
keyword value is simply specified as '1PE' instead of '1PE(400) ), then
CFITSIO will automatically scan the table when it is closed to
determine the maximum length of the vector and will append this value
to the TFORMn value.

<P>
The same routines that read and write data in an ordinary fixed length
binary table extension are also used for variable length fields,
however, the routine parameters take on a slightly different
interpretation as described below.

<P>
All the data in a variable length field is written into an area called
the `heap' which follows the main fixed-length FITS binary table. The
size of the heap, in bytes, is specified by the PCOUNT keyword in the
FITS header. When creating a new binary table, the initial value of
PCOUNT should usually be set to zero. CFITSIO will recompute the size
of the heap as the data is written and will automatically update the
PCOUNT keyword value when the table is closed.  When writing variable
length data to a table, CFITSIO will automatically extend the size
of the heap area if necessary, so that any following HDUs do not
get overwritten.

<P>
By default the heap data area starts immediately after the last row of
the fixed-length table.  This default starting location may be
overridden by the THEAP keyword, but this is not recommended.
If additional rows of data are added to the table, CFITSIO will
automatically shift the the heap down to make room for the new
rows, but it is obviously be more efficient to initially
create the table with the necessary number of blank rows, so that
the heap does not needed to be constantly moved.

<P>
When writing row of data to a variable length field the entire array of values for
a given row of the table must be written with a single call to
fits_write_col.
The total length of the array is given by nelements
+ firstelem - 1.  Additional elements cannot be appended to an existing
vector at a later time since any attempt to do so will simply overwrite
all the previously written data and the new data will be
written to a new area of the heap.  The fits_compress_heap routine
is provided to compress the heap and recover any unused space.
To avoid having to deal with this issue, it is recommended
that rows in a variable length field should only be written once.
An exception to
this general rule occurs when setting elements of an array as
undefined.  It is allowed to first write a dummy value into the array with
fits_write_col, and then call fits_write_col_nul to flag the
desired elements as undefined. Note that the rows of a table,
whether fixed or variable length, do not have to be written
consecutively and may be written in any order.

<P>
When writing to a variable length ASCII character field (e.g., TFORM =
'1PA') only a single character string can be written.  The `firstelem'
and `nelements' parameter values in the fits_write_col routine are
ignored and the number of characters to write is simply determined by
the length of the input null-terminated character string.

<P>
The fits_write_descript routine is useful in situations where
multiple rows of a variable length column have the identical array of
values.  One can simply write the array once for the first row, and
then use fits_write_descript to write the same descriptor values into
the other rows;  all the rows will then point to the same storage
location thus saving disk space.

<P>
When reading from a variable length array field one can only read as
many elements as actually exist in that row of the table; reading does
not automatically continue with the next row of the table as occurs
when reading an ordinary fixed length table field.  Attempts to read
more than this will cause an error status to be returned.  One can
determine the number of elements in each row of a variable column with
the fits_read_descript routine.
